# FAQ

## How are my plots generated?

All plotting capabilities of {{sciplot}} are powered by [gnuplot].  Your
plotting code, using a modern and elegant C++ API provided by {{sciplot}}, is
converted to a gnuplot script, which is then executed to generate the desired
figure. Note that gnuplot 4.2+ is needed for multiplots.
